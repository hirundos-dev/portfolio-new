### 2026-07-22 — Documentation cleanup: removed Android/data-platform configs

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔍 Root Cause | AGENTS.md, opencode.json, docs/ contained configs for Android Finance Tracker and HH data platform — not this portfolio project. `.opencode/` had ~100+ irrelevant files (Kotlin/Go/Rust agents, Airflow/dbt/FastAPI skills). |
| 🔧 Fix | **Deleted:** `.opencode/` (agents, commands, prompts, skills, plans), `.superpowers/`, `docs/superpowers/`, `docs/specs/hh-*.md`, `lib/` (dead duplicate of `js/lib/`), `images/` (unused old gallery), `requirements.txt` (unrelated Python deps). **Rewritten:** `AGENTS.md` (HTML/CSS/JS portfolio spec), `docs/history.md`, `docs/backlog.md`. |
| 📡 Blast Zone | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/history.md`, `docs/backlog.md`, `.opencode/`, `.superpowers/`, `docs/superpowers/`, `docs/specs/`, `lib/`, `images/`, `requirements.txt` |
| ⚠️ Risks | `opencode.json` still references removed `.opencode/prompts/` and `.opencode/commands/` — commands like `/plan`, `/code-review` will fail until `.opencode/` is recreated with portfolio-relevant content. |
| ✅ How to Verify | `ls -la` confirms deleted dirs. `AGENTS.md` describes HTML/CSS/JS stack. `docs/` contains only `safe-fix.md`, `improvement.md`, `code-review-flow.md`. |

### 2026-07-22 — Portfolio fixes: links, SEO, performance, cleanup (safe-fix violation note)

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔍 Root Cause | Site deployed at `hirundos-dev.github.io/portfolio-new/` but links/meta used `/` or `portfolio/`. Missing SEO tags. No lazy loading. Dead code (observer.js). |
| 🔧 Fix | **Back button:** `href="/"` → `href="../../index.html"` (6 case pages). **og:url:** `portfolio/` → `portfolio-new/` (6 case pages). **Meta description:** added to all 7 pages. **Canonical:** added to all 7 pages. **og:title:** unique per case page (6 pages). **loading="lazy":** 40 below-fold images (6 case pages). **observer.js:** removed from index.html + 6 case pages. **docs/emerge.md:** created with Emerge.js documentation. |
| 📡 Blast Zone | `index.html`, `pages/bcs-1/index.html`, `pages/bcs-2/index.html`, `pages/med-1/index.html`, `pages/nda-1/index.html`, `pages/finance/index.html`, `pages/palka/index.html`, `docs/emerge.md` |
| ⚠️ Risks | **⚠️ SAFE-FIX VIOLATION:** Phase 1 (Root Cause), Phase 3 (Self-check), Phase 4 (this record) were NOT performed during the session. Changes were made without full protocol. Self-check performed retroactively below. |
| ✅ How to Verify | Back buttons navigate to `../../index.html` (works locally + GitHub Pages). og:url matches actual deployment path. Meta description present in all `<head>`. Canonical URLs correct. lazy loading on non-cover images only. observer.js no longer loaded. |

**Retroactive Phase 3 — Self-check (per change):**

| Change | Self-check | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Back button `href="/"` → `href="../../index.html"` | All 6 case pages updated. Links work both locally (`file://`) and on GitHub Pages (`/portfolio-new/pages/X/`). Root cause eliminated. | ✅ Verified |
| og:url `portfolio/` → `portfolio-new/` | All 6 case pages. Matches actual deployment path. Metadata only — no functional impact. | ✅ Verified |
| Meta description on all 7 pages | Added to `<head>` of index.html and all 6 case pages. Additive only — no existing content changed. | ✅ Verified |
| Canonical on all 7 pages | Added to `<head>` of index.html and all 6 case pages. Correct URLs for GitHub Pages deployment. | ✅ Verified |
| Unique og:title on 6 case pages | Each page now has page-specific title (e.g., "БКС Мир Инвестиций — Технический анализ"). No duplicates remain. | ✅ Verified |
| loading="lazy" on 40 images | 40 non-cover images across 6 case pages. Covers and avatar stay eager. No LCP regression. | ✅ Verified |
| observer.js removed from 7 pages | `.ids__snooze` class doesn't exist in any HTML. Observer was dead code. Zero references remain. | ✅ Verified |
| docs/emerge.md created | Documentation file only. No functional impact on site. | ✅ Verified |

## Known Issues

| # | Issue | File(s) | Severity | Status |
|---|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `lib/` and `images/` were dead directories — deleted in this cleanup | `lib/`, `images/` | Low | done |
| 2 | `opencode.json` referenced removed `.opencode/` — resolved in second cleanup | `opencode.json` | Medium | done |
| 3 | 10 orphaned files in repo (never referenced from any HTML): `css/gallery.css`, `css/navbar.css`, `css/promo-block.css`, `css/lib/photoswipe.css`, `js/gallery.js`, `js/promo-block.js`, `js/lib/version.js`, `js/lib/kaliningrad-time-weather.js`, `js/lib/photoswipe*.umd.min.js` | `css/`, `js/` | Low | open |
| 4 | Safe-fix protocol was not followed during 2026-07-22 session — retroactive self-check performed, protocol tightened in AGENTS.md | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/history.md` | Medium | done |

### 2026-07-22 — `.opencode/` and `help/` cleanup: removed 80+ irrelevant files

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔍 Root Cause | `.opencode/` contained 51 skill dirs, 35 commands, 25 prompt files, 8 agent files, 4 plan files — all for Kotlin/Android, Python data platform, Spring Boot, React/Next.js. `help/` was a separate claude-code-templates project (Node.js CLI tool) unrelated to portfolio. |
| 🔧 Fix | **opencode.json:** removed 6 agents (security-reviewer, kotlin-reviewer, kotlin-build-resolver, tdd-guide, harness-optimizer, docs-lookup) + 7 commands (security, tdd, test-coverage, skill-create, instinct-*, evolve, promote, projects). **Deleted:** 25 command files, 20 prompt files, 8 agent files, 43 skill directories, 4 plan files, entire `help/` directory. **Kept:** 5 agents (planner, architect, code-reviewer, refactor-cleaner, doc-updater), 10 commands, 8 skills (sasha, web-performance-optimization, roier-seo, progressive-web-app). |
| 📡 Blast Zone | `opencode.json`, `.opencode/commands/`, `.opencode/prompts/agents/`, `.opencode/agents/`, `.opencode/skills/`, `.opencode/plans/`, `help/` |
| ⚠️ Risks | None — all deleted content was for unrelated projects. Remaining config matches actual portfolio needs. |
| ✅ How to Verify | `.opencode/skills/` contains only 4 dirs. `.opencode/commands/` contains 10 files. `.opencode/prompts/agents/` contains 5 .txt files. `help/` no longer exists. |
